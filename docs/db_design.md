# Database Design

## Overview

All structured data is stored in a single PostgreSQL instance accessed via Prisma ORM. Binary assets (videos, images, PDFs, evidence frames) are never stored in the database, only the S3 key is stored as a string reference. Pre-signed URLs are generated on-demand by the API at request time.

## Design Notes

- All primary keys are UUIDs to avoid enumerable IDs on public-facing endpoints (e.g., certificate verify URL).
- S3 keys are stored as strings; pre-signed URLs are generated on-demand by the API with short expiry (15 minutes).
- `submitted_at` on `QuizAttempt` uses the device-side timestamp to support last-write-wins conflict resolution during offline sync.
- `attempt_number` on `QuizAttempt` increments per `(guide_id, quiz_id)` pair and this is enforced at the application layer before insert. There is no upper bound on `attempt_number` — there is no retake limit, no cooldown period, and no admin reset mechanism. Guides may retake as many times as they are willing to pay.
- `DeviceAssignment.unassigned_at = null` means the assignment is currently active. Only one active assignment per device should exist at any time and this is enforced at the application layer.
- BillPlz payment integration is active. A `Payment` row is created (status `PENDING`) when a guide initiates a retake. On BillPlz webhook confirmation the status updates to `PAID`. When the guide creates a new `QuizAttempt`, the `PAID` payment row is linked via `quiz_attempt_id`. The application layer must enforce that `attempt_number > 1` requires a `PAID` payment row with `quiz_attempt_id = null`.
- `UserBadge` records must only be created for users with `role = GUIDE`. Admin accounts do not earn badges — admin authorisation is assumed by role assignment. This is enforced at the application layer.
- `station_id` on `User` is guides-only. Admin accounts are never assigned to a station. The application layer must enforce this — do not set `station_id` when creating admin accounts.
